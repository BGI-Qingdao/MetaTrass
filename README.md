Description:
---
**MetaTrass** is abbreviation to **Meta**genomics **T**axonomic **R**eads For **A**ssembly **S**ingle **S**pecies. MetaTrass is based on high-quality referencess with taxonomic tree and long-range information encoded within co-barcoded short-read sequences. The comprehensive use of co-barcoding information and references in our approach can reduce the false negative effects of genome taxonomy by using co-barcoding information while reduce the false positive effects of co-barcoding information by using references.

How to install:
---
1. MetaTrass can be installed via git channel:

        # First-time installation
        git clone https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/MetaTrass.git

        # for upgrade
        git add *

2. You can either add MetaTrass's 3rd party dependencies to your system path or put specify full path to alias into the folder `MetaTrass/tools/` which can be found MetaTrass easily. 

Preparing before complementation:
---
1. **The input files** for MetaTrass include a folder that holds the sequence file of all query genomes.
     * stLFR data all are welcome!  
     * If you have the demand of others co-barcode data analyses, please contact us.

2. **The reference database** for kraken2 include a folder that holds the database. 
   Databases are pre-built, including the required hash.k2d, opts.k2d, and taxo.k2d files.
     * For **Human Gut**:  
       We recommend the UHGG taxonomy database which can be download from [MGnify Genomes](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/mgnify_genomes/human-gut/v1.0/uhgg_kraken2-db/).

     * For [**Zymo Community Standards 10 Mock**](https://github.com/LomanLab/mockcommunity):  
       You can download the reference database from [Mock Community](https://lomanlab.github.io/mockcommunity/mc_databases.html)

     * Or for **Customized Microbiome** grouping:  
       Please check the NCBI official species taxonomic ID to add into the NCBI taxonomy.  
       To build a realiable construction of the species tree, please remind that the reference genomes for MetaTrass should be non-redundant genome of all single-speices. :warning:

3. **The reference genome** for refining the contigs should be kept with the reference database.
     * Split library.fna which can find in uhgg_kraken2-db/library/ (see above) to each single species fasta file  
      You can use the script (MetaTrass/script/fa_split_by_taxid.py) to covert the library.fna to single species fasta file. 
      
     * If you already have the single-species, please ensure the filename format with taxid_genomic.fa, such as 1104_genomic.fa.

4. **The reference genome size** information. :warning:
      * Get each of single species genome size as the configure file with two column:  
        table example:  
	
		|taxid	 | genome size(bp)|
		| :----- | ----: |
		|1000|2176737|
		|1001|6092914|
		|1002|3864718|
		|1006|2741290|
		|1007|3003526|
		|1008|1739566|
		|1009|1809170|
		|1010|4528241|
		|1011|2149385|
		|1013|2260187|

      * Please note that the genome size table file without any header line. :warning: :warning: :warning:
