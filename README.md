# MetaTrass

## Description
**MetaTrass:** **T**axonomic **R**eads **F**or **A**ssembly **S**ingle **S**pecies to **Meta**genomics

We developed an assembling pipeline named MetaTrass with using both high quality references in public databases and long-range information encoded within co-barcoded short-read sequences. With great potential in genome assembly of co-barcoded library, many different co-barcoded libraries have been reported recently, but the single tube long fragment read library have been used in developing our tool. The comprehensive use of co-barcoding information and references in our approach can reduce the false negative effects of genome taxonomy by using co-barcoding information while reduce the false positive effects of co-barcoding information by using references.

## Usage:

usage: trass.py [-h] 
               -sample SAMPLE \
               -fq1 FQ1 \
               -fq2 FQ2 \
               -outdir OUTDIR \
               -label LABEL \
               -min_depth MIN_DEPTH \
               -max_depth MAX_DEPTH \
               -kraken_db KRAKEN_DB \
               -kraken_fa KRAKEN_FA \
               -genome_sz GENOME_SZ \
               -threads THREADS \
               -strategy STRATEGY \
               -idba_ud IDBA_UD \
               -supernova SUPERNOVA \
