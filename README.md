Description:
---
**MetaTrass** is the abbreviation from **Meta**genomics **T**axonomic **R**eads **A**ssembly **S**ingle-**S**pecies. 

MetaTrass is the first metagenome assembly tool implemented by binning-first-assembly-later strategy and it is freely available at https://github.com/BGI-Qingdao/MetaTrass.

MetaTrass integrates the cobarcoding and the reference genome information to achieve high capability of generating high-quality genomes at species level for the human gut microbial commuities.

MetaTrass uses the cobarcoding correlation between short length reads to reduce false positives in conventional taxonomic binning and improve the contiguity of draft assemblies.

Usage 0.1:  Configure the reference database:
---
1. **The reference database** for kraken2 includes a folder that holds the database. 
   Databases are pre-built, including the required hash.k2d, opts.k2d, and taxo.k2d files.
     * For **Human Gut**:  
       We recommend the UHGG taxonomy database which can be downloaded from [MGnify Genomes](http://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/metagenomics/mgnify_genomes/human-gut/v1.0/uhgg_kraken2-db/).

     * For [**Zymo Community Standards 10 Mock**](https://github.com/LomanLab/mockcommunity):  
       You can download the reference database from [Mock Community](https://lomanlab.github.io/mockcommunity/mc_databases.html)

     * Or for **Customized Microbiome** grouping:  
       Please check the NCBI official species taxonomic ID to add it to the NCBI taxonomy.  
       To build a reliable species tree, please use non-redundant genomes for the references. :warning:

2. **The reference genome** for refining the contigs. Should be kept with the reference database.
     * Split library.fna which can be found in uhgg_kraken2-db/library/ (see above) to single species fasta file.
       You can use the script (MetaTrass/tool/fa_split_by_taxid.py). 
       
     	```
		python3 /path/to/MetaTrass/tool/fa_split_by_taxid.py -reffna /path/to/kraken2-db/library/library*.fna -outdir /path/to/single-genome-fa/ 
		```
     
     * If you have already the single species fasta file, then please use taxid_genomic.fa as the filename, such as 1104_genomic.fa. 
	
3. **The reference genome size** information table :warning:
      * Get each single species genome size as the configure file with two columns. For example :
	
		|taxid	 | genome size(bp)|
		| :----- | ----: |
		|1000|2176737|
		|1001|6092914|
		|1002|3864718|
		|1006|2741290|
		|1007|3003526|
		|1008|1739566|
		|1009|1809170|
		|1010|4528241|
		|1011|2149385|
		|1013|2260187|

      * Please note that the genome size table file has no header line. :warning: :warning: :warning:
      * Please refer to the tables in MetaTrass/Config/all_single_species_genome_size.uhgg.txt. 
      * You can use the script (MetaTrass/tool/ref_genome_size.py) to get species genome size information and generate the above table. 
      
        	python3 /path/to/MetaTrass/tool/ref_genome_size.py -refdir /path/to/single-genome-fa/

Input Sequencing files:
---
1. **For stLFR sequencing data**
     * 1. Raw data 
     
       If you are using raw data, please split the barcode first to get clean data.
       We offer the _MetaTrass GC_ function to gain clean data
       ```
       python3 /path/to/MetaTrass/Trass.py GC -rawfq1 rawfq.1.fq.gz -rawfq2 rawfq.2.fq.gz -outdir /path/to/output/ -runnow yes 
       
       ```
	
     * 2. Clean data 
     
       If you have clean data, please directly run the MetaTrass's TB and AP steps.
	
2. **For 10X Chromium sequencing data**	
     * 1. Raw data:
     
       If you have 10X Chromium data, please convert them to stLFR format.
     		
     * 2. Clean data: like publicated dataset.  
     	Using Athena MOCK20 sequencing data ([ATCC MOCK20 10X data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX3727063%5baccn%5d)) as an examples.

2. -max_depth: limiting the reads number of species by barcode unit when over the threshold depth (default: 300).
3. -PCT: the purifying step required, threshold of contig length (default: 0.5, range: 0-1).
4. -IDY: the purifying step required, threshold of IDY (default: 1, range: 80 - 100).


* Notices
1. extreme-high depth species: 

MetaTrass embedded Supernova as the assembly tool, which gains a longer continuity of genome but takes a longer assembly time compared to other tools. If meet the ultra-high depth species, it will fail to assemble because Supernova has a strict monitoring mechanism of input coverage. In particular, we recommend using other linked-reads' assemblers, such as cloudSPAdes, to re-assemble these species or you can use [MetaTrass_lite](https://github.com/QYanwei/MetaTrass_lite)..

2. barcode with high interspecies shared: 

Some co-barcoding or linked-reads data may crash, which means barcodes are shared by several species. We developed a tool to remove those reads with shared barcodes, named TABrefiner_NOS. You can alias the MetaTrass/tools/TABrefiner_NOS to MetaTrass/tools/TABrefiner. Using the command "ln -s TABrefiner_NOS TABrefiner" is easy to replace. Please keep both versions of TABrefiner.

3. others co-barcoding data:

If you have linked-reads data, please convert them to stLFR format. Since the number of long fragments with the same barcode in linked-reads is greater than that of stLFR reads, more false-positive reads are introduced into the co-barcoding refined read sets, leading to the unsuccessfully assembling of several species by Supernova. We recommend using other co-barcoding assemblers, such as CloudSPAdes, to re-assemble these species or you can use [MetaTrass_lite](https://github.com/QYanwei/MetaTrass_lite)..
